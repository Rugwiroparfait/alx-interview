# Pascal triangle.
Pascals triangle or pascal's triangle is a an arrangment of a binomial coefficient in triangular form.

## key points:

### 1.Numbers at both ends are "1"
#### example:

               1
             1   1
            1  2   1
          1  3   3   1
as shown the all side-diagnals are consisted by "1"s both sides.

### 2. Remaining numbers are sum of nearest numbers above
from the example above you can see that the next array is consisted by that one and sum of thenumbers above



## note:
pascal Triangle is widely used in probabilty theory,combinatorics and algebra.
